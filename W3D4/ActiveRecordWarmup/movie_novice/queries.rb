=begin
ActiveRecord queries have two methods, to_sql and as_json, that you might
find helpful for debugging. The specs use as_json -- feel free to refer
to them while writing your queries.

find, find_by, find_by_#{attribute}, etc. all return the first matching
instance from the database; where returns a collection of instances,
regardless of the number. Be careful about whether you are expecting
the object itself or a collection-wrapped object/set of objects.
